<p>Words matter.</p>

<p>This tool exists to make you aware when your project is using words that
make others feel unwelcome. We start with a basic list of terms that evoke 
racist, sexist, or ableist overtones, and look through source code 
repositories for these terms, to encourage you to use more welcoming, 
inclusive language in your project.</p>

<p>No, this doesn't solve the problem, but being aware when you're creating
an unwelcoming space can be the first step towards more significant
efforts to be more inclusive, welcoming, and sensitive to the feelings
of your community.</p>

<p>We encourage you to <a href="https://inclusivenaming.org/">read more about 
this effort</a>, and what you can do to make the world a more welcoming place.</p>
