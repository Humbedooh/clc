Changes in 1.1.2:

- Added a simple mechanism for interpolating clc::foo vars into the UI HTML pages
- Added a 'remove project' feature to the UI/API ([#5](https://github.com/Humbedooh/clc/issues/5))
- When git operations fail, log and show a warning in the UI instead of crashing ([#4](https://github.com/Humbedooh/clc/issues/4))
